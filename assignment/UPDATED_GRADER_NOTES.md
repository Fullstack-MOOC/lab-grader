- Reduced image build time significantly

### 2. **Grader Script Performance**
- Added cross-platform timeout support (works on Linux, macOS, and in Docker)
- Optimized npm installation with better timeout handling (300s limit)
- Added npm configuration for faster downloads
- Added fallback mechanisms for all commands
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. **Key Improvements**

- ✅ Proper JSON test result extraction
- ✅ 100% score reported for test 2 (all 6 tests passing)
- ✅ Better logging for Coursera debugging
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing dev servers

## 📊 Test Results
- **Score**: 100% (1.0000 fractional)
- **Component Tests**: 3/3 passing
- **E2E Tests**: 3/3 passing

## 🚀 Files Updated
- `Dockerfile` - Optimized for faster builds
- `grader.sh` - Improved performance and cross-platform compatibility

## 📦 New Zip Contents
- `grader.zip` contains both updated files

## 🔑 Key Changes in grader.sh

3. Grading should complete in ~1-2 minutes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
If you still see issues on Coursera:
1. Check the grading logs for any error messages
2. Verify package-lock.json is included in submissions
3. Ensure test files are properly formatted Cypress tests
